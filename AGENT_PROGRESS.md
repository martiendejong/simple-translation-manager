# Agent Progress

## 2026-07-20 — task 869cay7hb
Done: Elementor widget translation integration, PR #15 (`STM\ElementorIntegration` — translated content stored separately from Elementor's own `_elementor_data`, frontend overlay filter, editor translation panel, 3 REST endpoints).
Verified: `vendor/bin/phpunit` 54/54 pass, `npx jest` 7/7 pass, `php -l` clean, CI green (lint + PHP tests + JS tests) on the PR.
Left: no live Elementor click-through — no reachable WordPress+Elementor install exists in Jengo's infrastructure. Task's original "install XAMPP" ask was declined (see PR body/ClickUp comment for why); ships through this repo's existing PHPUnit-only workflow instead, matching all 12 prior merged STM feature PRs.

## 2026-07-20 — task 869e6vpgg
Done: PR #14 — `includes/class-string-scanner.php` tokenizes the active theme (child+parent)
and the plugin's own `templates/` dir for literal `__stm()`/`_e_stm()` calls, registers each
new key/context in `wp_stm_strings`, and seeds its default-language translation with the
discovered fallback text. Runs on `stm_activate()` and via a new "Scan theme & plugin for
strings" button (`Admin::scan_strings()`) on the Strings screen. Both paths check for an
existing row before inserting, so re-scanning never duplicates strings or overwrites a
translation a human has since edited.
Verified: `php -l` clean on all changed files; `vendor/bin/phpunit` 28/28 passing (15 baseline
+ 13 new StringScanner tests covering token parsing, comment/dynamic-arg exclusion, dedup,
idempotent re-run, and manual-edit preservation). Added `class-string-scanner.php` to
phpunit.xml's tracked `<source><include>` list (it was missing, which made the CI diff-coverage
gate silently report "nothing to gate" instead of actually measuring the new code — the same
gap that bounced a sibling PR in this repo); after the fix CI's diff-coverage gate genuinely
measures 89.01% (162/182 lines) on the new file, comfortably over the 80% threshold. PR CI
(PHP unit tests, JS unit tests, PHP lint) all green. No live WordPress instance in this
environment, so the actual wp-admin Strings screen was not visually verified.
Left: nothing outstanding for this task.
